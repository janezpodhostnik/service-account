# Update FlowServiceAccount Contract to add the reference to DependencyAudit contract

> June 13th, 2024

Upgrade to the `â€˜FlowServiceAccount` contract

See issue: https://github.com/onflow/service-account/issues/294

## Transactions

1. Upgrade `FlowServiceAccount`.

Needs to be signed with the service account.

Used this to generate the contract code arguments:

`cat "./FlowServiceAccount.cdc" | xxd -p | tr -d '\n'`

Verified using:
```
$ cat arguments-update-FlowServiceAccount.json | jq '.[1] | .value' | xxd -r -p > /tmp/temp.txt
$ diff /tmp/temp.txt FlowServiceAccount.cdc
(Should produce no difference)
```
